Hapi Bootstrap
==============

Here is the base files to build an API on top of Hapi.

The goal of this repository is to play with Hapi and its plugins and see how we can arrange the code base.

Left to do: 
  - Tests
  - Validation
  - Errors
  - Authentication (route not authenticated, and route authenticated --> how to arrange the routes, how to do middleware-like)
  - API key protected route
  - jwt protected route
